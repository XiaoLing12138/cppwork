# Final Project for CPP class (2020 Fall)

## Running Environment
1. ARM-Board EAIDK-310
2. OpenCV 4.2.0
3. CMake 3.11.2
4. GCC 8.1.1 20180502 (Red Hat 8.1.1-1)

The Array Version can run correctly, but the Mat Version has a unknown error.
Maybe it is the compiler's bad.

## The weight and bias are using the trained model provided by teacher.
## The pictures used to test are copy from the Internet, you are not allowed to use them for profit.
